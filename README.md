# Sports Jersey Image Classification

 In order to learn methods behind image classification this repository will contain a small project that will take a bunch of photos of jerseys from different sports and look to correctly identify which sport the jersey is associated with. The images used in this dataset were taken from boathouse.com, allvolleyball.com, cricketbestbuy.com, dickssportinggoods.com, soccerpro.com, amazon.com, and rallyhouse.com.
